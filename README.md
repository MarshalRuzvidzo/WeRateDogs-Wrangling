# WeRateDogs-Wrangling
data wrangling of WeRateDogs Twitter account
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment 
about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, 
though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're
good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 9 million followers now and has received 
international media coverage. This project wrangled and analysed the data on the WeRateDogs as they 
stood on August 1, 2017
